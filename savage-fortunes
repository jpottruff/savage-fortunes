And I am the cream.
%
And I've got something to say to Elizabeth! 
%
And the beat goes on yeah. And the beat goes on yeah. And the beat goes on...
%
And the videoscope yeah.. I'm looking right into you.
%
And there is no-one that does it better than the Macho Man Randy Savage!
%
AND YOUR NECK COULD BE BROKEN!
%
Because they can't handle the Macho Man Randy Savage: the Cream of the Crop!
%
Being a wrestler is like walking on the treadmill of life. You get off it and it just keeps going.
%
Best there is… past present and future! Ohhhhh yeahhhh!
%
Bonesaw is ready!
%
Bow down to the kingdom of the Madness!
%
But the cream will rise to the top.
%
But these arms ain't chopped liver!
%
Comparatively speaking to the Macho Man Randy Savage you're nothing but garbage!
%
Cup o' coffee in the big time yeah.
%
Dig it!
%
Do you think you're what our forefathers were thinking about when they thought up the American Dream? 
%
Elizabeth…. I LOVE YOU!
%
Elizabeth…Elizabeth…will you marry me?
%
Every sport has its own cast of characters.
%
Expect the unexpected in the kingdom of madness!
%
From wrestling to my hip-hop thing I've just been able to do so much and meet so many crazy characters.
%
Hey freakshow! 
%
Hulkamania is like a single grain of sand in the Sahara desert that is Macho Madness.
%
I am the cream in the World Wrestling Federation and there is no doubt about it.
%
I am the cream yeah the cream of the crop.
%
I feel so fortunate that I had a second chance to marry my first love here where it all began.
%
I hate you I hate your guts! And that's what's going to be left all over the mat.
%
I have no regrets.
%
I used to hate old-timers who didn't praise the younger wrestlers but you've got to pass the torch sometime.
%
I say I'm a million percent. That is better than a hundred percent!
%
If it's good enough for Hercules it's good enough for me.
%
I'm ALWAYS jittery! It's part of my personality!
%
I'm better than you are yeah and I'm talking everyone in the World Wrestling Federation.
%
I'm funky like a monkey. 
%
I'm the Macho Man Randy Savage and I'm the World Wrestling Federation Champion and YOU'RE NOT.
%
I'm talking about all the way to the top yeah.
%
It's enough to get me to the boilin' point!
%
I've been in the danger zone.
%
I've got something to say to zillions of people all around the world! 
%
Let me tell you now a man of my position can afford to look ridiculous at any time.
%
Let me tell you something right now!
%
Love it or leave it.
%
Nobody does it better!
%
Not only are you a hot dog a grand stander a showboat and a prima donna but you're a liar too.
%
Nothing means nothing!
%
Oh yeah? 
%
Ooooh yeah I don't think so.
%
Ohhhh yeeeeah!!!
%
Ohhhh yeeeeah I'd like to know.
%
On balance off balance doesn't matter.
%
Rules? Well rules were made to be broken. 
%
Snap into a Slim Jim!
%
Sky's the limit and space is the place!
%
The cream rises to the top!
%
Ten thousand years as Intercontinental Champion.
%
The tower of power too sweet to be sour. 
%
The madness is runnin' wild!
%
The match the whole world Jupiter Saturn  Venus… Or anywhere else is waiting for.
%
The same fire the Dragon breathes. He shall burn by.
%
There are no tough guys in wrestling.
%
There's an airplane going by and I'M NOT ON IT!
%
Thirty-six years ago Lynn and I met on Lido Beach.
%
Too hot to handle too cold to hold!
%
We're in space and space is the place!
%
What a great way to see all of our legacies live on through the video games.
%
What can I say about this move? Nothing so I won't.
%
When anger rushes unrestrained to action like a hot steed it stumbles on its way. The man of thought strikes deepest and strikes safely.
%
Who's in the danger zone?!
%
Woah! FREAK OUT!
%
Wrestling is a fraternity and the boys will work their butts off for you as long as you respect them and don't lie.
%
Yeah I do yeah.
%
Yeah what were you doing at Wrestlemania? 
%
You can't let anyone walk all over you or everybody will walk all over you.
%
You weren't there to gloat were you? No I guess you weren't.
%
You will eat my rear rockets and like it! Ohhhh yeahhh!
%
You're goin' NOWHERE! I got'cha for three minutes! Three minutes of playtime!
%
Your mustache is crooked!
